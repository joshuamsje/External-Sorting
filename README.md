# External-Sorting
Uses a input bin that has a ton of bytes. 16 bytes makes up a record so this project creates a record object for every 16 bytes in the bin and stores those bytes in an input buffer. Then takes the input buffer and stores the buffer into a min heap of type record. The MinHeap then sorts the records using the 2 8-bytes in each record as a key and compares them. Then uses replacement selection sort to continuously sort records in the minHeap as well as take in more records from the input buffer. Then stores those records from the minHeap into an output buffer. Finally, uses merge sort to sort the entire output buffer.
